Getting Started
=============================

In order to recreate this project, first you need to pull the COPA Police Complaints "Complainant Summary" data from the Chicago Open Data Portal.

Next download the Police Beats Shapefile, either from the Open Data Portal or from my github folder "static" This data is publically available

Finally run the createmap.py to process the police complaints data, merge it with the beats shapefile, and create maps of the parameters you choose
